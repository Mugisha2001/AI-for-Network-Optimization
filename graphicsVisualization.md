op Graph: Actual Congestion Levels
Interpretation: This shows the real congestion states (likely binary: 1 for congested, 0 for not congested).
Behavior:
There are rapid transitions between congestion and non-congestion states.
This indicates a dynamic network environment, possibly under varying loads or conditions.
Bottom Graph: Predicted Congestion Levels
Interpretation: This shows the model's predictions for the congestion states, based on the trained algorithm.
Behavior:
Similar to the actual levels, but there may be slight deviations where the prediction doesn't align perfectly with the actual state.
This represents the accuracy and error in your model's predictions.
Comparison and Observations
Visual Similarity:
The predicted graph follows the actual graph closely, which indicates that the model is performing reasonably well.
Misalignments may occur where predictions fail to capture abrupt changes in congestion states.
Model Strengths:
If the two graphs overlap significantly, the model is capturing key patterns in the data effectively.
Model Weaknesses:
Differences between the graphs suggest areas where the model struggles, such as handling sudden transitions or noise in the data.
